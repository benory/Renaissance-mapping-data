Monsieur: Jean Mouton is going to Loreto and will pass through Ferrara, as he has said. You will see him and give him a fond welcome, because he deserves it. Besides being gifted he is the most
humble man that one can find, and a good servant of God. I commend him to you as strongly as I can. I will bring you some musicâ€”a mule-load of it. It is said here that within a short time the king will go to Bologna and from there to Ferrara, but one cannot really be sure.

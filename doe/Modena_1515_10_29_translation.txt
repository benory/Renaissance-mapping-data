I have been looking for some needy beggars but up to now I haven't found any. These singers have some as servants but they really are beggars, and, besides, they wouldn't leave their masters. I hope that one day I will be able to go there and to furnish your lordship as I would like to do. Longaval is master of the king's chapel. Messer Jean Mouton has given me a motet for the victory and certain other motets and chansons, which on my return I will present to you. And I will tell you privately who among them sing well, and how, and in what way. Then, we haven't yet found anyone who is equal to our Bidon; and his lordship the duke certainly has a good pack of singers, and the proofs have now been made. If they come to Ferrara, your lordship will enjoy both the one and the other. The habits of this king; he gets up late and goes late to bed; he goes willingly on foot, but doesn't enjoy music as much as the former king did.

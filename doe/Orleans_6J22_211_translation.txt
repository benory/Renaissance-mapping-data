\f0\fs24 \cf0 I, Eloy d\'92Amerval, master of the children of the church of Saint-Aignan in the suburbs of Orl\'e9ans, confess to having had and received from Michael Gaillard, counsellor and general treasurer of my lady the duchess of Orl\'e9ans, the sum of four livres, one sol, six deniers tournois which he paid on my account; that is, to Pierre Garendeux 59 sols tournois and in deduction from what is due to me from my wages from my late lord the duke of Orl\'e9ans whom God has absolved; from which sum of four livres, one sol six deniers tournois I consider myself happy and well paid and as proof thereof her said treasurer and all others witness my signature given the 25th of June 1471. \

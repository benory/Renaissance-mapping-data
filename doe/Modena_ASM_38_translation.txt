Greetings, etc.: Yesterday Turluron came to see me and said that he had in his hands a contrabass, the best in Italy; and, remembering the injunction I had made to him in your excellency's name, he had wished to notify me before anyone else. I thanked him in your excellency's name, and then asked him the singer's name. He told me that it is a certain La Fage, a man recently arrived with Monsignore d'Auch, who has departed and has left him here, ill, with some other boys who sing very well. He told me all this not supposing that I know him, but in fact I do know him, and according to the pope's judgment he is a great man; and his holiness does not know that he does not want to return to the service of the Cardinal of Auch. I have given him to understand that he should not say a word to anyone until he receives an answer from your illustrious lordship. But he tells me that if he goes to stay with anyone he wants the boys to go with him, and he wants a benefice. I have not spoken with La Fage, who is my friend, because he was ill and because I thought that he had returned to his country with the Cardinal of Auch. I know very well that he sings very well and composes, as I understand from those who know more about this than I, and I know that he has been hunted by Monsignore Lang and Monsignore Cibo——that is, they are looking for him. [Continues on the ages of the putti and promises to keep Ippolito informed.]

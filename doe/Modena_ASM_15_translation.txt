Giovanni Carole, the watchmaker, who is operating [or repairing?] the clockwork here that he has made for this Signoria, tells me that a singer here has written the work that is enclosed with this letter. He says that it is considered an excellent work, and has asked me to send it to Your Excellency, both to have it sung by your singers, and to have it looked over by that singer of yours named messer Josquino, the most excellent composer, to see if it is praiseworthy. For if Your Excellency judges it to be a good work, as the true musician that you are, he will undertake to let you have other worthy compositions like this one by that same composer or singer. For this reason I am sending it to Your Illustrious Lordship so that if it gives you pleasure you can give me your opinion about it. He says that the composer does not wish to reveal his identity until he knows that his work is pleasing to Your Excellency.

Most illustrious Lord: I spoke with the most reverend Archbishop of Bari about that singer, and he told me that he had never been able to find him. I have done all I could to find him, and I have not even been able to locate Turluron, but at any rate I will find him. I have told Carpentras to let him know that I have something to talk to him about, without, however, telling him what it is. I will not fail in this for anything in the world.

Most Reverend Cardinal and Lord. Several days ago I wrote to you concerning Verdelot, again recommending him to you. It was with confidence that I had him come, considering that a person of his qualities would be welcome and satisfactory first to you and then to everybody else, with the honest salary that it seemed to me he merited. Wherefore, since he is personally there [Florence], and if you think he merits that for which he has come, I recommend him to you, believing that you will be well served by him. And I hope (God willing), after the Feast of St. Peter, to come there and stay a few days to enjoy myself with you and our friends, to whom I continually recommend myself, praying God that He keep you in a healthy and happy state. That is all, farewell. Rome, May 25, 1521.

From Your Servant,

Nicolaus, Prior, Papal Chaplain, and
Provost of St. Catherine in Cremona

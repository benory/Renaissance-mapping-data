My Lord, I believe that there is neither lord nor king who will now have a better chapel than yours if Your Lordship sends for Josquin. Don Alfonso wishes to write this to Your Lordship and so does the entire chapel, and by having Josquin in our chapel I want to place a crown upon this chapel of ours.

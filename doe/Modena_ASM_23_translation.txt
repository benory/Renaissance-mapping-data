When I return I will tell you privately everything about the chapel and I will bring your lordship some new music. My "cousin" Lourdault sends greetings to your lordship; he is with the king. Turluron is going to France, and has been commissioned to bring back singers. My father sends greetings to you, and he and I together pray you to deign to look to our house if you should have need of anything, and we put our trust in you.

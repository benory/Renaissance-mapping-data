We commend you for the books and plays which you have given to Coglia, even if we have not yet received them, since he left them at Lyons to be sent on with other things. Josquin the singer is not yet here, but we are looking forward to his arrival from hour to hour with keen anticipation. Because of the rapidity of Coglia's journey here, he left him behind, so that he might come at a more comfortable pace.
Thus we shall also praise you for your troubles in seeing that we receive that Mass which the Most Christian Majesty has promised you to have made. Hasten to procure it and send it to me, for it will please me very much.

Most illustrious and most reverend Lord ... I have spoken with Turluron, and he has told me that Jacotin Frontin, of whom I am writing, left for France about a month and a half ago, to become master of the chapel of the Most Christian King [Francis I]. I have told him that if anyone really gifted in this art should turn up, he should let it be known to the Most Reverend ... if such a person should be the right one for your lordship, he will be notified as to what he should [do].

Most Illustrious Lord: I must notify Your Lordship that Isaac the singer has been in Ferrara, and has written a motet on a fantasy entitled 'La mi la so la so la mi' which is very good, and he wrote it in two days. From this one can only judge that he is very rapid in the art of composition; besides, he is good-natured and easy to get along with, and it seems to me that he is the right man for Your Lordship. Signor Don Alfonso bade me ask him if he would like to join Your Lordship's service, and he replied that he would rather be in your service than in that of any other lord whom he knows, and that he does not reject the proposal; and he has taken the period of one month to reply as to whether he will serve or not. We have accepted that term for taking him into service (only in order to advise you about it) and we have promised him 10 ducats a month, provided that you approve, and we ask you if you will deign to let us know if you approve of this or not. To me he seems well suited to serve Your Lordship, more so than Josquin, because he is of a better disposition among his companions, and he will compose new works more often. It is true that Josquin composes better, but he composes when he wants to, and not when one wants him to, and he is asking 200 ducats in salary while Isaac will come for 120â€”but Your Lordship will decide.

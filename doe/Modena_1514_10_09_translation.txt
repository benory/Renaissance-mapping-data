I am herewith sending to your excellency a Fors seulement for three voices, which I am sure will please you, even if its composer is an Italian.

The singer that I have taken on for your excellency sings tenor. That Jacotin has gone to the service of the Cardinal of Aragon. He tells me that he would like to go into your service, as he does not like his present situation. I did not want to give him hope nor to take him on until
your excellency advises me as to what I should do. His voice is soprano.

At Rome Turluron and Frate Francesco put into my hands a young Frenchman who sings soprano, and according to them he is a new Bidon. But because his singing didn't please me, either in the quality of voice or in the manner of singing, I didn't want to take him on unless he was first approved by Carpentras. But since Carpentras was coming back after his holiness, I haven't been able to clear this up, and I didn't want to rely only on the opinions of Turluron and Frate Francesco because it seems to me that they are not doing their duty in giving these singers to your lordship. It was their fault that Jacotin was lost; trusting in their word, I relied on them, for which I was afterwards sorry; because this Jacotin sings well and has a good deal of the manner of Mouton, and I would gladly have seen him in your excellency's service.
